        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/250269785415402">ChariTech</a> is the place to be if you want to do something to make a real difference. Whether you have never seen a single line of code before, or whether you've used technology your whole life!
          <br><br>
          Join Hackers at Cambridge at the end of term on the 17th of March for 12 hours of hackathon madness, where we’ll be introducing you to a whole range of different charities who need your help. You’ll be working with these charities to produce new and innovative products and solutions which will really be able to make a difference.
          <br><br>
          Beginners are welcome, even if you have never heard the word ‘hackathon’ before! If you have experience working with a charity, we would love you to come and need your skills & ideas. You may even learn something new too!

        <em>HaC Nights</em> are your weekly chance to hang out with like-minded people and learn new tech skills together or work on that side-project you've had in mind. Whatever your experience level, you are welcome at HaC Nights. If you're just getting started, there'll be plenty of people here willing to help you out. We bring the snacks, you bring your ideas, laptop and questions, and there's bound to be someone in the room with the answers.
