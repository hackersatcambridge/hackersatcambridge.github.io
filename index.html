        <h2>ChariTech</h2>
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/250269785415402">ChariTech</a> is the place to be if you want to do something to make a real difference. Whether you have never seen a single line of code before, or whether you've used technology your whole life!
        <br><br>
        Join Hackers at Cambridge at the end of term on the 17th of March for 12 hours of hackathon madness, where we’ll be introducing you to a whole range of different charities who need your help. You’ll be working with these charities to produce new and innovative products and solutions which will really be able to make a difference.
        <br><br>
        Beginners are welcome, even if you have never heard the word ‘hackathon’ before! If you have experience working with a charity, we would love you to come and need your skills & ideas. You may even learn something new too!
