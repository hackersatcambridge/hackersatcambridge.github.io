        Hackers at Cambridge are putting together a series of short videos explaining the computer science topics that we have found challenging. We hope this can help during the revision push! If you have any ideas for topics you'd like to see explained, let us know at <a href="mailto:team@hackersatcambridge.com">team@hackersatcambridge.com</a>

        <em>HaC Nights</em> are your weekly chance to hang out with like-minded people and learn new tech skills together or work on that side-project you've had in mind. Whatever your experience level, you are welcome at HaC Nights. If you're just getting started, there'll be plenty of people here willing to help you out. We bring the snacks, you bring your ideas, laptop and questions, and there's bound to be someone in the room with the answers.
